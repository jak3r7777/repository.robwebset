== Introduction ==
You can install this addon from: [https://www.urepo.org URepo Repository]
<br />
<br />
The Recap addon is an addon that allows you to "Catch Up" with what has happened in a given TV Episode. It uses the site [http://www.recapguide.com www.recapguide.com] and will display a small description and 50 images to jog your memory for what happened.
<br />
<br />
This is useful if you watch TV an entire season/series and then watch the episodes back-to-back. This means it can be almost a year between watching each season/series, and this addon can help remind you what has happened.
<br />
<br />
It can be run from the Programs section, or call up the context menu on a TV Show/Season/Episode and you can get the recap on that show (For episodes, there is also an option to get a recap for the previous episode).
<br />
